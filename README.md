# Central Limit Theorem Simulation - Project
This repository contains a project created for the Probability and Statistics course 2022/23 at AGH UST. It also includes a report written in Polish.

## Description
The project is a simulation of the [Lindeberg–Lévy Central Limit Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem). The user can choose the number of test samples, the length of each sample, and one of the proposed distributions to generate sample values.

## Technologies Used
The project was written in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) language using the [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) library. These tools are required to run the simulation locally. I recommend using [RStudio](https://posit.co/) for launching application.

The final result is also hosted on [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/) and can be accessed through [this link](https://dadamczyk.shinyapps.io/Central_limit_theorem/).
